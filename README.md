## Introduction

**Tired of seeing this page?** Have you ever wondered why you should even face this problem? If you think you DO DESERVE a normal life like others all around the world, stand up for your rights.

There are many unfair sanctions on our country, here I want to describe the ways in which I can switch services and etc to have nicer experience with whom respects my nationality.
The rule of thumb here is not to use online services as you can.

## Gmail

I have switched to [Tutanota](https://mail.tutanota.com/) instead of gmail. the experience is great and you can buy its subscription with the help of [Iranicard](https://www.iranicard.ir/) without any problem.

## Chrome

### Browser and Bookmarks

Firefox is awesome ðŸ’ƒ

### Password Manager

I store my passwords using [gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) on Github.

## DockerHub

Github container registry is faster, free and respects nationalities.

## Google Keep

I write my notes on emacs and sync it with Github.

## Overleaf

I write my latex document on my own system. with some scripts is far better than overleaf experience.

## Trello

I use emacs for my tasks, tracking them and etc. without any problem. I also sync them with Github

## Golang

Sadly I must use golang because it is my primary language but sites like [go.dev](https://go.dev/) is free but currenltly I am trying to switch.
Languages like [Rust](https://ziglang.org/) or [Zig](https://www.rust-lang.org/) are free and awesome replacement for Go.

## Dropbox, Google Drive

I use [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) to share files between my system without any issue.
