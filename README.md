# no-sanction

## Introduction

There are many unfair sanctions on our country, here I want to describe the ways in which I can switch services and etc to have nicer experience with whom respects my nationality.

## Mail
I have switched to [Tutanota](https://mail.tutanota.com/) instead of gmail. the experience is great and you have buy its subscription with the help of [Iranicard](https://www.iranicard.ir/) without any problem.

## Password Manager
I have stored my passwords with [gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) on Github.

## Browser and Bookmarks
Firefox is awesome ðŸ’ƒ

## Repositories
Github is an awesome place to code, share and review them. It has support Iran without any problem right now.

## Container Registry
Github container registry is faster, free and respects nationalities.

## Notes
I have wrote my notes on emacs and sync it with Github.

## Overleaf
I have wrote my latex document on my own system. with some scripts is far better than overleaf experience.
